## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://fruitfulejiro.github.io/Convo/]

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Icons - [Font-Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/)


### What I learned

Utilizing CSS Grid: I learned how to leverage CSS Grid to create responsive and flexible layouts, making it easier to arrange and align elements within the web page effectively.

Creating a Hamburger Menu with CSS and HTML: I gained the knowledge of building a stylish and functional hamburger menu solely using CSS and HTML, which enhances user experience and navigation on smaller screens.

Implementing Media Queries: I discovered the power of media queries to apply different styles and layouts based on the user's device screen size, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.


### Continued development

In the future, I plan to enhance the project by incorporating a carousel feature. This carousel will enable users to scroll through images seamlessly, providing a more interactive and engaging browsing experience. By integrating this functionality, I aim to make the content presentation more visually appealing and user-friendly.
